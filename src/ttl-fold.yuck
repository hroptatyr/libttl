Usage: ttl-fold [FILTER] < NQUADS

Fold triples or quads into reified meta data.

This is an online variant of:

SPARQL CONSTRUCT {
        ?x rdfs:subject ?s .
        ?x rdfs:predicate ?p .
        ?x rdfs:object ?o .
        ?x a rdf:Statement .
} WHERE {
        BIND(foaf:name AS ?p) .
        ?s ?p ?o .
        BIND(IRI(CONCAT('http://hash/',
		hash(STR(?s), STR(?p), STR(?o)))) AS ?x) .
};

with a special hash function, murmurhash3.

FILTER should be a valid turtle file whose subjects should
be the predicates of NQUADS to filter for.  The predicates
and objects of a statement will be appended to the reified
statement.

Objects in the filter file of the form <@PREFIX[:SUFFIX]>
or "@PREFIX[:SUFFIX]" will be treated as PREFIX[SUFFIX] in
the output but with @prefix PREFIX declared in NQUADS.
If an IRI or a literal starting with @ need to be inserted
use \@ to escape that character.
